Information Theoretic Security And The One Time Pad

- A cipher consists of two algorithms: an encryption algorithm (E) and a decryption algorithm (D), and operates within a defined environment, represented as a triple:

1. Key space (K): The set of all possible keys.
2. Message space: The set of all possible messages.
3. Ciphertext space: The set of all possible ciphertexts.

- The encryption algorithm (E) takes a key and a message as inputs and outputs ciphertext. 

- The decryption algorithm (D) takes a key and ciphertext as inputs and outputs the original message. 

- The algorithms must satisfy the correctness property, ensuring that encrypting a message with a key and then decrypting it with the same key returns the original message.

- Efficiency is a key requirement for the algorithms, though its definition varies. In theoretical contexts, it means the algorithms run in polynomial time relative to input size. 

- Practically, it means they perform within acceptable time limits, such as encrypting a gigabyte of data in under a minute.

Two key points about ciphers and introduces the one-time pad cipher:

1. Efficiency in encryption algorithms (E): 
   - The term "efficient" is flexible and depends on context. For theory, it means the algorithm runs in polynomial time relative to input size. For practical use, it refers to meeting specific time constraints.
  
   - Algorithm E (encryption) is often randomized, meaning it uses random bits during encryption to enhance security.  
   - Algorithm D (decryption) is deterministic, always producing the same output (original message) for a given key and ciphertext.

2. Introduction to the one-time pad cipher:
   - The one-time pad was designed by Vernam in the early 20th century and is an example of a secure cipher.

- The key space is basically the same as the message space which is again simply the embed of all binary strings. So a key in the one time pad is simply a random big string, it's a random sequence of bits. That's as long as the message to be encrypted, as long as the message. 
 
   - Message space and ciphertext space: Both consist of all possible binary strings (sequences of 0s and 1s).  

   - Key space: Keys are random binary strings as long as the messages they encrypt. 
 
   - Encryption in the one-time pad is straightforward: it combines the message and key using a simple operation.



The workings of the one-time pad cipher:

1. Encryption process:
   - The ciphertext is calculated as the **XOR** of the key (K) and the message (M):  
     Ciphertext = K XOR M  
   - Example:  
     - Message: `0110111`  
     - Key: `1011001`  
     - Ciphertext: `1101110` (result of bitwise XOR)

2. Decryption process: 
   - The original message is retrieved by XORing the key with the ciphertext:  
     M = K XOR Ciphertext 
   - Example verification:  
     - Ciphertext: `K XOR M`  
     - Decrypting: `K XOR (K XOR M)` simplifies to `M`, because:  
       - `K XOR K = 0`  
       - `0 XOR M = M`  

3. Consistency property:  
   - The process ensures that decrypting a ciphertext using the same key returns the original message, satisfying the correctness requirement for ciphers.

4. Security of the one-time pad:  
   - While itâ€™s demonstrated that the one-time pad functions as a valid cipher, its security properties have not yet been discussed.  

Key Recovery from Message and Ciphertext:

- If given both the message (M) and the ciphertext (C), it is straightforward to recover the key (K):
K = M XOR C

- This property is due to the reversibility of the XOR operation.
Performance Advantage:

- The one-time pad is computationally efficient, requiring only a simple XOR operation for encryption and decryption, making it very fast for long messages.
Practical Limitation - Key Management:

- The key must be as long as the message, which creates significant challenges:
For Alice to securely communicate with Bob, she needs to securely transmit a key of the same length as the message beforehand.

- This defeats the purpose of using the cipher since the secure transmission of such a long key could be as difficult as securely transmitting the message itself.
Conclusion and Future Application:

- While the one-time pad is impractical for real-world use, its underlying principle inspires other cryptographic techniques. Further discussion on these adaptations will follow later.
